	<h>Motivation Factor Towards Online Education<h><br>

	<b>1.Method</b><br>

All schools and university are now close and this is the best way to learn and teaching using online methods.</i><p>

	<b>2.Create a timetable</b><br>
		<h style="color:green"<p><i>Keeping your goals realistic and attainable requires a sensible schedule. It might help to make a list of everything you have going on, from online courses and work to family obligations and social time. Online instructor Jarin Eisenberg suggest  creating a master schedule for every two months and setting artificial deadlines for your schoolwork. Prioritizing your work by ranking everything from very important to not important, is also helpful. Remember that online courses allow you to set your own schedule, so avoid the out of sight, out of mind situation by logging in on a regular basis.</i></p>
	
	<b>3.Stay positive</b><br>
		<h style="color:indigo"<p><i>Feeling overwhelmed or getting behind can cause stress  which is seriously demotivating. While its not easy to turn a negative attitude into a positive outlook, it will definitely help you keep going when you want to procrastinate on an assignment or dont feel like logging in to attend a lecture. If you try to stay positive throughout your online course experience, you will find it makes everything a little easier.</i></p>

	<b>4.Reward for ourself</b><br>
		<h style="color:red"<p><i>Accomplishing a goal or completing a project feels great, that alone is rewarding, but doing something nice for yourself can create even more internal motivation. As Eisenberg advises, celebrate the little achievements. For example, if you reach your weekly goal, you might treat yourself to brunch over the weekend. What makes you happy? Give it to yourself to acknowledge your accomplishments.</i></p>
